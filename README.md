# TestingTask

## Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment includes Node.js and an npm package manager. Check it with following commands:

- node -v ( if Node.js is installed);
- npm -v ( if npm packages are installed).

In order to get Node.js please visit https://nodejs.org/en/.
npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

## Install the Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally with the command:

- npm install -g @angular/cli

## Install all packages that the project depends on

Run the command:

- npm install

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
